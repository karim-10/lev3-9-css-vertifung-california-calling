            <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ <br> resilience, our design team reimagined the
                California <br> Grizzly and used it to create custom tees, pins and <br> posters.</p>

            pop-up shop during <br> our SF Design Week Studio Crawl this Friday, June 21. You <br> can choose what
            amount to
            donate. All proceeds will go to <br> the American Red Cross to help the communities that are <br> still
            displaced.

            <h3>This design is all about the resilience of <br> California to overcome difficult <br> situations and
                come out
                stronger than <br> before. It’s a flip of the UNC Tarheel <br> mascot with added elements like the <br>
                California
                poppy. <br><br>

                down. <br><br>
